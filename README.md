# foorLoop_MP3




Objective: The objective of the problem is to understand the behaviour of a looping structure using FOR loop.

Each problems is given a point of 98% for every correct solution.


1. Compute the factorial of 13. 

2. Compute the sum of the first 100 even numbers. 

3. Each number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. 
   The first two numbers in the sequence are 1 and 1. Compute the tenth Fibonacci number. 
   
   
    Note* In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
    such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1
